    This project is made for fun and learning. We can't promise good results with speed and security.
    We want to start small but go bigger with time and all help is welcome.

    We are building the 2D part in priority but we also want to support 3D,
    The majority of the project will be in C++ but some parts will be in C.
    some scripts or tools can be in other languages (ex: bash scripts, Python, etc).
